#  Automated Testing Framework

## ðŸ“Œ Project Summary
This is a robust Automated Testing Framework built with Python, Pytest, and Selenium WebDriver for testing web applications. The framework is designed for scalability, maintainability, and ease of use, featuring a Page Object Model (POM), configuration management, cross-browser testing, detailed logging, HTML reporting, and CI/CD integration with GitHub Actions. It currently tests the login functionality of the SauceDemo website but can be extended for other web applications.

## Key Features

- Pytest: Flexible test execution and reporting.
- Selenium WebDriver: Browser automation for UI testing.
- Page Object Model: Modular and maintainable test code.
- Cross-Browser Testing: Supports Chrome and Firefox.
- Parameterized Tests: Efficiently tests multiple scenarios.
- Logging: Detailed logs for debugging (logs/ directory).
- Screenshots: Captures screenshots on test failure (screenshots/ directory).
- HTML Reports: Generates detailed test reports (reports/ directory).
- Configuration: Centralized settings in config.ini.
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions workflow for automated testing.

## Install Dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run Tests:
```
pytest tests/test_login.py -v --html=reports/report.html -n auto
```


## ðŸ§ª Extending the Framework

- Add New Tests: Create new files in tests/ using the same structure.
- Add Pages: Add new page objects in pages/ for other website sections.
- API Testing: Integrate requests for API testing.
- Data-Driven Testing: Use CSV/JSON files for test data.
- Advanced Reporting: Replace pytest-html with Allure for richer reports.
- Docker: Containerize the environment for consistency.
